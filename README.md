# EPL-Soccer-Results-Predictor

I've been a fan of football for as long as I can remember, so with my quest to learn as much as possible about data science, I decided to go ahead and build a results predictor for English Premier League Matches!

I end up demonstrating these capabilities through building a Poisson Distribution to evaluate probabilities of different results.
